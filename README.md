**What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?**

**Kernels** : As per EVA , Kernels are **feature** extractors or **3 X 3 matrix** or also called as **filters**  
              


   **Channels** are **similar** Feature Bags.

Let us under stand with the below example .

 We have a Biriyani image( Yummy   :)) .

Now Biriyani is made up of many different ingredients as shown below:

So here in the image we have separate ingredients which in case of Computer Vision can be said as Channels. Since Channels are collection of similar features. So in this case **all onions combined together is a CHANNEL** ,all tomatoes combined together is a separate channel so on and so forth.






**Kernels** : One **single** **onion** here is like a **kernel** , 
but  all onions combined together forms a channel.

For example in the below image all onions combined together forms a Channel.

Mostly CHANNELS are expected to contain similar information, but we can combine few channels and make a complex channel which may be conceptually similar.

For Example : In below image tomatoes, onions and garlic are mixed together to form a complex channel.
